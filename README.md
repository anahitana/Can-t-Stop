# Can-t-Stop
is a highly object-oriented game named "Can't Stop!" using
Java. The most prominent characteristics of the game are polymorphism,
encapsulation, abstraction, use of AI, low coupling and high cohesion
which were crucial elements of the project's success. I worked
collaboratively with a team to complete the project.
